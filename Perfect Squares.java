dp解 递推式为 min(1+dp[i-j*j]) for i>=j*j
 DP array stands for the least number of perfect square numbers for its index. For example DP[13]=2 stands for if you want to decompose 13 
 into some perfect square numbers, it will contains at least two terms which are 33 and 22

O(n*sqrt(n)) O(n)

Given a positive integer n, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...) which sum to n.

For example, given n = 12, return 3 because 12 = 4 + 4 + 4; given n = 13, return 2 because 13 = 4 + 9.
