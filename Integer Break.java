Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.

For example, given n = 2, return 1 (2 = 1 + 1); given n = 10, return 36 (10 = 3 + 3 + 4).

Note: You may assume that n is not less than 2 and not larger than 58.

Hint:

There is a simple O(n) solution to this problem.
You may check the breaking results of n ranging from 7 to 10 to discover the regularities.



any n>4 will guarantee to have a factor of 3

Why the max product of any n>4 must contain a factor of 3? 

1. It cant contain any factor x that is >= 5, o.w., we can further increase the max product by decomposing x, 
as the decomposed x when x>=5 is strictly greater than x;

2. Out of 1, 2, 3, 4, we know 1 wont be a factor of n when n>4, if n is an odd number, 3 must be there as a factor 
(2 and 4 cant add up to an odd number); 

3. Now say n is an even number (n>4) and only has factor of 2 and 4, we can always split a 6 to 3X3, which is better than 2X2X2.
Therefore, the max product of any n (n>4) must contain a factor of 3. The recurrence relation holds.

Further, as it holds for all n (n>4), we will be only using 3 as factor for n (n>4), we keep subtracting 3 until n<=4, and adopt the remaining factor

O(n)
